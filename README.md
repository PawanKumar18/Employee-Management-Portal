### **Database Contexts**

- **_ApplicationDbContext:_**  
  Handles ASP.NET Core Identity operations such as user data storage.

**Steps for Setting Up and Running the Application**

Update Connection Strings:
Ensure your appsettings.json file has the correct connection strings as shown above. Update the server name if you're using a different SQL Server instance.

Create the Databases:

Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Connect to your SQL Server instance.
Run the above SQL script to create the databases.
Import Schema and Data :

Select the EmployeeDB database in SSMS.
Open a new query window and execute your schema script db_schema.sql to create tables and constraints.
Import data_dump, open it and execute it to insert data into the tables.
Build and Run the Application:

In Visual Studio, right-click on the solution and select Restore NuGet Packages.
Build the solution (Build > Build Solution) or press Ctrl+Shift+B.
Run the application (F5 to run with debugging or Ctrl+F5 to run without debugging). The app should launch in your default browser at a URL like (https://localhost:7155/).
Test the Application:

Register a new user and log in.
Access features like Add Employee, View Departments, and View Salary History.
Apply Entity Framework Migrations (for Identity Database):

If you're not using SQL scripts for the Identity database:

powershell
Copy code
Update-Database -Context ApplicationDbContext
